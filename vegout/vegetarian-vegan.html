<h3>Real quotes</h3>
supermarkets sometimes, small markets- greengrocers, farmers markets, food group, ethical food,
organic food brands. <br>
Up to 50% cheaper with the food group, vegan, checked for ethics.<br>
Works ok. Needs to carry large amounts of food on her bike, hassle to transport. <br>
I've only ever gone online to buy cat food. Never for anything else.<br>
Would feel guilty for wasting the packaging, uses a reusable cup , so reducing waste. Eco issues relating to take-out.<br>
Can receive reusable packaging initially, some way to return/ keep their packaging.<br>
Biodegradable packaging.<br>
I'd spend 5 - 10 euro per dish, vegan company, interested in supporting initiatives that support her ethics/beliefs, if the business provides employment for a cyclist, she would be more supportive of the that. Give jobs to nice people, and to promote ethical sustainable business practices<br>
I shop in farmer's markets frequently<br>
Yes if it was the same price, she would prefer the online easier version.<br>
Currently uses one vegan online shop for cat food, free delivery.<br>
There are no vegan places in Dublin, the falafel places on dame street are so popular, people want to have nice vegetarian food. <br>

<h3>Real quotes</h3>
It's annoying that Lidl's far away. I'm not at home much, very busy , vegetables go off so I don't buy them."<br>
Ordered take-out very few times, failed at food ordering, it's easier to hop on bike. You need to create an account, and it's a waste of time."<br>
I need an account to sign into, so it's difficult and annoying to buy food."<br>
Take out packaging is annoying , there's too much of it"<br>
Raw food and juices are hugely popular at the moment." <br>
Only reason not to get take out is that it costs more than making food at home."<br>
I would spend 10 euro on a meal / wouldn't pay for delivery , I like going to the shop. I don't like the pollution involved in ordering from a delivery service, and organising the delivery is a pain when you're busy."<br>
